This is my personal [Custom Gradle Distribution] that I use in open source
projects of mine to avoid having to reconfigure the same things over and over
again. Especially because some things cannot be configured from anywhere other
than an init script. Feel free to use my distribution in your projects, but it
will always serve my personal needs first.
